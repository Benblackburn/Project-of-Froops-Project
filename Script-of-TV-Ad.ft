INT. WHITE ROOM -DAY

CARDINAL XAVIER, CARDINAL BIGGLES, and CARDINAL FANG are all standing in the middle of the ROOM.

CARDINAL XAVIER
Blimey, I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition myself.

CARDINAL BIGGLES
(annoyed)
What are we in heaven?

CARDINAL XAVIER
(reassuring)
Well, I don't think we're in heaven yet. But there is a table, with some of the General Biscuit's new product - the Bennie

CARDINAL XAVIER picks one piece up, and starts to introduce it to the audience.

CARDINAL XAVIER
The Bennie is a crispy bisuit filled with a buttery mixture that will be sure to make your taste buds yearn for more! Absolutely the best thing ever in the living mortal coil.
(whispering to CARDINAL BIGGLES)
Are we paid for this?

CARDINAL BIGGLES
Well I do hope so.

CARDINAL XAVIER
(whispering to CARDINAL BIGGLES)
To be frank, I don't know what we're doing here, let's wrap this up so we could be teleported back to our original universe.

CARDINAL BIGGLES
(whispering to CARDINAL XAVIER)
Alright then.

CARDINAL XAVIER
(enthusiastically)
The Bennie - so good that even the Spanish Inquisition likes it!

CARDINAL XAVIER
(whispering to CARDINAL BIGGLES)
Wait, isn't it The Bennie - so general it makes you aerial?

CARDINAL BIGGLES
(whispering to CARDINAL XAVIER)
It should be correct.

CARDINAL XAVIER
(whispering to CARDINAL BIGGLES)
Alright then.
